We currently are lacking a proper document displaying our weekly meeting minutes for events.

We need to create a "meeting minutes" page that will be used for the group to meet up synchronously in order to get an idea of what to do next.

Meeting together during lecture was an additional option, however it is not viable due to our requirement of participating in the lecture itself.
