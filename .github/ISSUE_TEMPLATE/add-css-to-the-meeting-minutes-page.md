The page currently looks very bland and empty, making it look unappealing as a result.

Implementing basic CSS can be used to make the website seem more coherent and nicer on the user's eyes.

Another way is by implementing Javascript to the page, however for this lab, we are required to use CSS instead.

Any additional page addons to make the page look nicer are encouraged
